# Text to Speech Translator App
This is a simple web application that converts text from a .txt file into speech in a selected language. The app is built using Python and Streamlit, leveraging the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library for text-to-speech conversion and the translate library for translating text between different languages.

Features
Text Upload: Users can upload a .txt file containing the text they want to convert to speech.
Language Selection: Users can select the language of the input text and the language in which they want the text to be vocalized.
Translation: The app automatically translates the uploaded text into the selected vocalization language.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: After translation, the app converts the text into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
Downloadable Audio: Users can download the generated audio file in .mp3 format.
